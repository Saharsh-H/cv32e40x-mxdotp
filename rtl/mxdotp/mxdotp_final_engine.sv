//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Description:
//   Standalone MXFINAL arithmetic engine - the FINAL half of what used to be
//   one shared mxdotp_execute module. See mxdotp_xif.sv's "pipelined
//   coprocessor" milestone header (mxdotp_pkg.sv) for the full rationale.
//
//   rs1=scales ({a_scale[31:24],ar_scale[23:16],b_scale[15:8],reserved[7:0]}),
//   rs2=old FP32 accumulator - BOTH plain 32-bit reads, no dual-read for
//   either, in any format.
//
//   RESIDUE-STYLE FORMATS ONLY as of the fused-fast-path milestone (see
//   mxdotp_pkg.sv's MX_SLOT_FUSED milestone header): plain (non-residue)
//   MXFP4/MXFP8 now go exclusively through mxdotp_fused_engine.sv and never
//   reach this engine at all. Because every instruction reaching this
//   engine is therefore guaranteed - by ISA convention, not a runtime check
//   - to be a residue-style format, the format mask this engine used to
//   apply is gone: p2/residue's contribution is now included
//   UNCONDITIONALLY, always. There is no mx_format input any more; nothing
//   left in this engine's own logic is format-dependent.
//
//   p1_i/p2_i are the "mailbox" snapshot - MXDOTP's raw, unscaled dot-product
//   sums. This engine captures them into its own private registers at
//   start_i, on the exact same cycle (and via the exact same mechanism) it
//   captures rs1_i/rs2_i - there is nothing special-cased about the
//   snapshot; it is an ordinary input capture like any other operand. The
//   caller (mxdotp_xif.sv) is responsible for only asserting start_i once
//   the mailbox actually holds valid data, and for freeing the mailbox the
//   same cycle - this engine has no visibility into "is the mailbox valid",
//   it just captures whatever is on p1_i/p2_i the cycle it is told to start.
//
//   MILESTONE (current): back-end pipelining for timing closure - see
//   mxdotp_fused_engine.sv's matching milestone header for the full
//   rationale (Vivado OOC synthesis measured this engine's own critical
//   path at ~28.55ns against a 10ns target, the identical root cause: one
//   unbroken combinational cloud from p1_q/p2_q/rs1_q/rs2_q all the way to
//   result_data_q, because acc_to_fp32 was a single monolithic function
//   with nowhere for a caller to put a register). This is "Option 2"
//   (balanced) applied here exactly as in mxdotp_fused_engine.sv: what used
//   to be one combinational stage (LATENCY_CYCLES-gated, but really just
//   one cycle's worth of logic regardless of the counter value) is now
//   THREE real stages:
//   - BACK1A: decode scales, calculate shift amounts, and perform variable shifts (place_in_acc).
//       Registers the three 74-bit shifted operands and their stickies. (The new cut).
//   - BACK1B: the 74-bit wide adder tree (summing the shifted operands).
//       Registers sum_q (the X|Y cut).
//   - BACK2: mxdotp_pkg.sv's acc_find_lead (leading-one scan) on sum_q ->
//       registers lead_q (the Y|Z cut - the single highest-leverage cut
//       identified from Vivado's timing report).
//     - BACK3: mxdotp_pkg.sv's acc_finalize (mantissa extract + sticky +
//       round + clamp) on lead_q -> result_data_q.
//   Each stage is a REAL single cycle now, not an artificial wait - the old
//   LATENCY_CYCLES parameter is gone, replaced by the genuine 3-stage
//   depth. Net latency: was LATENCY_CYCLES(2, placeholder wait around one
//   real combinational cycle) -> now 3 (three REAL 1-cycle stages) - a net
//   +1 cycle, not +3, since the old parameter was already "spending" one
//   cycle on a wait that didn't correspond to real pipeline depth.
//
//   ARITHMETIC (current milestone): the old absolute-window accumulate
//   (place_in_acc x2 + fp32_to_acc into the ACC_WIDTH=95 / ACC_ANCHOR=34
//   buffer) is REPLACED by a scale-free SLIDING-ACCUMULATOR frame, closing
//   the same truncation-at-extreme-scales class of bug that the plain-MXFP4
//   rewrite closed (the absolute window silently dropped whole scale/
//   magnitude ranges). This is the fourth sibling of the MXFP4/MXFP8/M2XFP4
//   sliding frames - see mxdotp_pkg.sv's "MXFINAL SLIDING-ACCUMULATOR FRAME"
//   section for the full derivation (anchor selection on p1==0; per-term
//   clamped placement; the three bypasses; and the from-first-principles
//   sizing MXF_FRAME_WIDTH=38, MXF_REMAIN_BITS=36, MXF_LZC_WIDTH=74).
//   Validated bit-exact RNE against an exact-rational reference
//   (mxfinal_golden.py) across 745k+ vectors, and the RTL itself confirmed
//   bit-identical to that golden model on 100k+ vectors via a Verilator TB.
//
//   BACK1 now: select the anchor (scale_exp(a,b) if p1!=0, else
//   scale_exp(ar,b) - one mux on p1==0, NOT a runtime leading-bit compare),
//   place the frame-resident product (p1, or p2 when p1==0) exactly, slide
//   the other product and the old accumulator in via the per-term clamped
//   shift, and OR their stickies. The -2 that fp4_to_code's *4 convention
//   needs is carried once by mxf_finalize's exponent term (NOT applied to
//   the anchor here - doing both would double-count it). p2/residue's
//   contribution is unconditional (no format mask; only residue-style
//   formats reach this engine post-split). BACK2/BACK3 are structurally
//   unchanged: mxf_find_lead (leading-one scan) then mxf_finalize (mantissa/
//   round/clamp), with the acc-verbatim bypass applied at BACK3.

// PIPELINE STAGES INTRODUCED (5 stages / 4 cycles latency):
// - Stage 1 (in_valid_q): Input capture. rs1_i, rs2_i, p1_i, p2_i are latched.
// - Stage 2 (back1a_valid_q): Scale decode + Shifters. The massive BACK1 combinational path is sliced in half. This stage calculates shift amounts and shifts the three terms (F, SECOND, acc), latching the three 74-bit shifted values and their stickies into back1a_*_q.
// - Stage 3 (back1b_valid_q): Wide Adder Tree. The three 74-bit shifted values are summed together into mxf_word_q.
// - Stage 4 (back2_valid_q): Leading-one scan (mxf_find_lead). Latches into lead_q.
// - Stage 5 (result_valid_q): Mantissa rounding/finalize (mxf_finalize). Latches into result_data_q.
// NEW CROSSED SIGNALS: The 74-bit shifted contributions from place_F, place_SECOND, and place_acc (and their stickies) now cross a new register boundary (back1a) before entering the wide adder tree.
